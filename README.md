# NAMSHI | Utils

This package contains a series of utilities that we have developed to be used when you need to do some low-level
dirty job and you don't wanna write a generic helper for your own application or an isolated function (you use objects,
don't you?).

## Installation

Via composer, as you find this library on [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/namshi/utils):

```
"namshi/utils": "1.0.*",
```

## Tests

Just use *phpunit*:

```
phpunit
```

and welcome to greenland.
